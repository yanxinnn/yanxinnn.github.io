  <div class='projectSubtitles'>The Problem</div>Staying on track with classes, work, meetings, assignments, and deadlines is hard. It's stressful enough when life seems to have it out for you and throws all the lemons it's got at you. But on top of that, you have to deal with schoolwork, work-work, life-work, all the things you need to work on, but for some reason, it's just not working out. <br><br><div class='projectSubtitles'>The Solution</div>I decided to tackle this great woe of our generation by building a chrome extension that helps users stay afloat in the hecticity of their everyday by providing them with a sanctuary in their New Tab page where they can stay organized, motivated, and sane, with light-hearted aesthetics, daily inspirational quotes, and built-in task management tools. <br><br>Users store their tasks as bottles that get added onto their New Tab page's waterscape and can view/update their tasks throughout the day. <br><br>Features include a time/date display, planner functionalities (create/edit/delete tasks, create/edit/delete subjects, progress tracker for tasks, and customizable color coded subjects), hand-drawn images and animations, and daily inspirational quotes.<br><br>This was my undergrad Senior Capstone Project that I plan to release onto the Chrome Web Store and is for those who need a planner and appreciate a bit of playfulness throughout their daily chrome browsing experience!<br><br><div class='projectSubtitles'>The Process</div>To create Float-it Notes, I: <br><div class='descriptionsIndent'>‚óã Conducted user research amongst 14-25 year olds to learn their planner usage and habits<br>‚óã Analyzed competitor tools and their funcitonalities<br>‚óã Conceptualized an alternative planner design that was whimsical and unique<br>‚óã Created and drew graphical assets for user interface<br>‚óã Designed and developed working prototype of chrome extension</div>",

  "My target audience is Chrome users on laptops/desktops ages 14-25. My initial user research goal was to find out my target audience's general online habits, their usage of planners, if any (physical and/or digital), their favorite aspects of their current solution, and parts of their current solution that don‚Äôt work for them. <br><br>These are the user research questions that I asked participants (ages 16-23) during one-on-one interviews.",

  "From my user research, I was able to understand who popular competitors are for futher competitive analysis, important planner functionalities that users preferred, and what tools are considered ‚Äúfluff‚Äù and/or unnecessary by a majority of them. <br><br>Here are some of the big takeaways from the interviews: <br><div class='descriptionsIndent'>1. Most of the participants use a digital planner with a few using a mix of both/only physical planners. Most of the digital planner users used Google Calenders, Notes app, or Trello to keep track of their schedules and to-do lists. <br><br>2. Benefits of using digital planners for participants include ease of organization (pre-formatted unlike physical planners), easy access on the phone/computer, being able to see a daily/weekly view of their schedule, a place to have important links, and reminders. Pain points of using digital planners include the lack of customization outside of text boxes, an overwhelming amount of tools that go unused, and the lack of sorting by subject/groups. <br><br>3. Benefits of physical planners include the freedom of formatting (not prestructured like digital planners), ability to add creative non-text additions, and a space for brain dump. Pain points include not being able to edit tasks like digital planners, it being harder to find what you‚Äôre looking for in all the pages, and needing to carry it around everywhere.",

  "Here are some of the competitors I researched that take over the New Tab page. I took note of each of their taglines, audiences, purposes, features, scopes, and visual styles.",

  "Based on my research findings, I came up with a list of considerations for my chrome extension to include features that users appreciate in a planner/task manager. I used the MoSCoW method to prioritize certain features to be completed in time for my Undergrad Senior Capstone Project Gallery Exhibition but plan to implement more of them before releasing my chrome extension onto the Chrome App Store!",

  <div class='projectSubtitles'>The Problem</div>Studies in 2021 have shown that more than 82 million US residents aged 6 and above don't exercise at all, making it more likely for them to develop a host of health problems like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease. On the other hand, the mobile gaming market is booming, with global mobile games revenue on track to surpass the $100 billion mark by 2023. <br><br>So here are our two facts: <div class='descriptionsIndent'>1. A lot of people don't exercise enough. <br> 2. A lot of people love their mobile games.</div><div class='projectSubtitles'>The Solution</div>This brought me to ask the question, what if working out was as addicting as a game? What if... it was a game? <br><br> \
  I designed Inertia, a mobile fitness game that helps members of the gaming community and RPG fans transform their gaming passions into a healthier lifestyle. <br><br>Inertia gives users a setting they are familiar and drawn to, RPG games, and motivates users to workout by recognizing their efforts with in-game rewards and progression. While the rewards of physical body changes from working out might take at least a few months to show, Inertia helps keep users excited for their next session by providing more immediate feedback every time they complete a run or workout.\
  <br><br><div class='projectSubtitles'>The Process</div>For this project, I: <div class='descriptionsIndent'>‚óã Researched exercise and mobile gaming statistics in the US <br>‚óã Analyzed competitor fitness apps and their features<br>‚óã Conducted two rounds of user research amongst gamers to learn my target audience's core needs and workout habits (1st round) and to recieve insight for how users interact with the mobile prototype (2nd round) <br>‚óã Generated user flows for different user experiences <br>‚óã Created a style guide for the app's colors, typography, buttons, and branding <br>‚óã Designed low and high-fidelity wireframes prototyping the sign-in/sign-up process for mobile and desktop, character creation, various game features (inventory, shop, skills, and Battle Tower system) and the workout experience for users.</div><button class='slidesLink' onclick=\"window.open('https://www.figma.com/file/4GKpbsBQxAKKfarmcLW0tp/Inertia','_blank')\">View Figma Designs</button>",

  "I started this project with background research on exercise and mobile gaming, primarily in the US, to gain an understanding of how my hybrid app can potentially bridge the gap between these two industries. <br><br>Further competitive analysis of various fitness apps showed how current solutions were addressing the problem of inactivity among US residents and the various features that made them successful/stand out, giving me ideas for features to incorporate into Inertia.",

  "My first round of user research's goal was to learn my target audience's core needs and workout habits. <br><br>I surveyed 16 participants, ages 15-21, that played at least 3 hours of games a week, and asked them questions concerning their gaming and exercise habits and preferences. These surveys were done through Google Forms for anonymity as some people may not be comfortable disclosing sensitive information such as how much they exercise, how long they spend playing games, etc.",

  "Main findings from the first round of user research included: <div class='descriptionsIndent'>1. Participants‚Äô reasons for playing games were for entertainment, escape, or socialization. <br>2. What participants found most appealing about RPGs were the storylines, the game completion/achievements, ability to play with friends, the sense of progression, and character creation and customization. <br>3. Most of participants that did work out either did light workouts a few times a week just to keep active and did not have workout equipment. <br>4. Participants' motivations for working out were for physical changes, more energy, self-esteem, sports-related, and mental health reasons. </div>This research was crucial in understanding the target audience and their needs and served as a guide for the brainstorming and subsequent designs of Inertia.",

  "I created multiple user-flows for different user motives, such as a user-flow for returning users logging on to complete a workout (using Workout) and a user-flow for returning users preparing character for the Battle Tower (using Shop, Skills, Inventory, Battle Tower).",

  "The second round of user research was live 1-on-1 recorded interviews with participants on either Zoom or Discord testing for app navigation and usability. <br><br>In these 10-15 minute interviews, participants were given a link to a mobile prototype of Inertia and asked to share their screen while I asked them a series of questions and gave them tasks to complete within the app.",

  "From the second round of user research, I got a lot of valuable feedback that I incorporated into the final design of Inertia. As my users were all gamers interacting with Inertia for the first time, they were able to bring in their own knowledge and understanding of games they are used to playing, helping me improve the user experience of Inertia as not only a fitness app, but also as a functional and enjoyable game. <br><br>Highlighted bullet points in the image indicate popular/repeated feeback from participants.",

  "The app's game portion is an RPG. Users play as a character of a class of their choosing (warrior, mage, priest, archer, or assassin) as they battle their way through floors of the virtual world‚Äôs dungeon, called the Battle Tower, either solo or with friends. The battle system is turn based, with each player/enemy character using their mana to cast an ability on their turn. The battle ends when all the characters of a side has no health left. <br><br>Players can make their characters stronger with equipment and skill points they gain from working out. They can sell/buy/customize their equipment in the Shop, level up their unique class skills/abilities in Skills, and change their equipment and character appearance in Inventory.",

  "The fitness portion of the app consists players completing runs or workouts for the chance to obtain better equipment and to gain skill points to aid them in their Battle Tower climb. <br><br>The first few floors of the Battle Tower can be defeated without grinding out runs and workouts to give users a taste of what the gameplay is like and hopefully, make them excited to exercise to continue advancing. The rewards from these workouts scales with the user's in-game progression. <br><br>To ensure that users are honestly working out, the app will require users to verify their exercises by scanning QR codes on workout machines, using their phone's camera to track their movements, or linking to a heart rate monitor.",

  "Inertia's designs adhere to a style guide to make sure that the app's colors, typography, buttons, and branding are consistent throughout all the pages for a holistic user experience."

  "Competitive analysis was done with 6 of the most popular room and/or roommate finder and other apps with similar functionalities. They were distinguished by competitor type, priorities, key features, region accessibility, and KPIs. <br><br>From this research, opportunities were found to include the following features into Room:<div class='descriptionsIndent'>‚óã Combine Tinder's swiping feature with Roomi's background checks and in-depth questionnaires to ensure mutual safety and increase user excitement for sharing commonalities with their matches<br>‚óã Have a wide selection of search parameters for users to filter roommates and rentable rooms<br>‚óã Make app accessible worldwide and available in multiple languages<br>‚óã Landlords' profiles and details shown on listings for easy user access<br>‚óã Different communication methods available such as text, call, and video call so people can familiarize with one another online before meeting in person<br>‚óã Include ratings and testimonials for landlords and rooms/apartments from past renters<br>‚óã Include additional resources to help users transition smoothly into their new shared space (paying bills, splitting chores, buying shared groceries, etc.)</div>",
  
  "The goal of our user research was to understand the concerns and desires 18-25 year olds have in regards to the roommate/room  searching process. Participants were asked about their past or current rooming experiences, their experience with NYU's roommate matching system (if applicable), their current solutions to finding a roommate or room, and their level of comfort in using quick digital transaction to pay for rent.<br><br>The surveys were carried out through anonymous Google Forms which were sent out to the NYU community, friends, and friends of friends.",

  "Our research of 21 participants, with an age range of mostly 18-23, found that the majority of them:<div class='descriptionsIndent'>‚óã Have a roommate<br>‚óã   Prefer to live with one roommate<br>‚óã Find NYU's roommate matching system's personality quiz successful in pairing roommates that get along<br>‚óã Would love for NYU's process to have more options/preferences for selecting roommates and to have the ability to connect with potential roommates beforehand<br>‚óã Use Zillow as the main app to find places to live</div><br>\
  The main worries participants have surrounding finding a roommate all fell into the categories of:<div class='descriptionsIndent'>‚óã The cleanliness of the roommate<br>‚óã Possible personality/lifestyle clashes<br>‚óã Communication problems</div><br>\
  It was also found that:<div class='descriptionsIndent'>‚óã There is a 50/50 divide in trusting Venmo<br>‚óã Those that said they trusted Venmo for paying their rent expressed it was because of the convenience and ability to confirm transactions with checks<br>‚óã Those that expressed concern about using Venmo for their rent gave the reason of Venmo being informal</div>",

  "From the user research, we were able to optimize Room's filtering system to make sure that users are able to search for roommates and rooms by the categories most important to them. It also gave us a clear picture of who our target demographic was, their situations, their motives, and their fears, informing the construction of our 2 personas, Naomi and Arjun.<br><br>While Naomi and Arjun are both searching for a roommate, their differences in age, occupation, personalities, likes/dislikes, and circumstances mean that their criterias for a roommate are very different. During the designing of Room, we looked through the eyes of Naomi and Arjun to make sure that the experience our app provided was versatile and useful for a broad spectrum of users.",

  "Journey maps created for Naomi and Arjun showcase two scenarios where users use Room to find a roommate. Each of these experiences have their own high and low points of user satisfaction. These journey maps pinpoint pivitol moments where we can capitalize on the positives emotions and take proactive steps to ease the negative feelings.",

  "Our 2 user flows for new and returning users show the different screens they visit and decisions they make as they complete their goals within the app. This ensures that each step of their in-app experience is efficient and makes sense.",

  I conducted a survey with 25 people to find out which of these 10 were the most appealing to others. From this feedback, I was able to narrow down the possible designs to 3. <br><br>I then created sevaral iterations of the 3 designs, playing around with fonts, colors, spacing, and other design elements. Shown in the image are some of the iterations of the 3 chosen designs.",
